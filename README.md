# Material-Time-Calculator
This will be my first app. I am new to Java and development so this should be interesting. My idea is to create a material design time calculator capable of adding and subtracting times. For example: 1h35m+20m+1h=2h55m or 1h50min-50min=1h
I already have some ideas for the code but since I am new to Java I don't know if they are possible. 
I am willing to develop this because there are already apps that do this but none of those features material design.
